        <blockquote>
          “I’ve always loved beautiful things. It’s human nature to be attracted to beauty, isn’t it? Since I started venturing into my own business, I’ve invested time into curating beautiful things. I love all things beauty, so in combining the things I love, I came up with my own beauty brand.
          <br><br>
          My goal has always been to prove to people that beauty is not superficial. Beauty is also about being kind to yourself, to your skin, to your mind. I was inspired to produce effective products with the best possible ingredients and formulation.
          <br><br>
          Turning ideas into reality has always fascinated me. I’ve always liked the thought that a concept, something I envisioned in my mind, can become a tangible thing I can see and touch. I always liked the idea of creating something I can call my own, breathing my own life into it.”
